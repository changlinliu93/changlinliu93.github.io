Hi, my name is Changlin Liu. I'm a CS Ph.D. student of [RISE-Lab](https://engineering.case.edu/groups/xusheng-xiao/home/) of the [Department of Computer and Data Sciences](https://engineering.case.edu/computer-and-data-sciences/) at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/). My research fields include Software Engineering, Software Testing, Mobile Software, System Security and Threat Intelligence.

# Research Projects
**Generating accurate Window Transition Graphs for Android Apps.** Window transition graph is a model for the GUI of an Android APP. It descibes the transitions among windows caused by interacting with the GUI widgets. In this project, we combine static analysis, dynamic analysis and machine learning to overcome the low coverage or over-approximation problem.

**Classifying and extracting information from CTI blogs.** Open threat intelligence blogs contain abundant information about security incidents and malicious behaviors. In this project, we utilize state-of-the-art NLP techniques to identify highly valuable blogs and extract information from them. The knowledge obtained can be used for various security applications.

**Detect malicious behaviors in system audit logs.** System audit logs contain rich information of the state and transition of a computer system. These logs are typically collected through recording low level system call events and are thus noisy and huge. We explore methods to detect communities in the system dependency graph and seperate anomalous edges using causality analysis and machine learning.
